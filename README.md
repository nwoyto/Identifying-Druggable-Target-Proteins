# Identifying-Druggable-Target-Proteins
Identifying druggable target proteins by biochemical composition 

# To Do:
1.) Run RF and XgBoost on compressed data from kerasMLP.
2.) Determine False positives for each model and percent certainty it was incorectly assigned.
3.) Compare False Positives. Look for overlapping proteins & analyze. 
4.) Suggest Proteins that are incorrectly assigned as nondruggable proteins. 
5.) Rename files to make for easier readability, explain flow of notebooks in README.
6.) Look to make dynamic visuals.
6.) Powerpoint Presentation discussing findings.
